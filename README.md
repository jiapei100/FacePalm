Face/Palm Measuring Tool: A stand-alone software for standardized hand and face morphometry

This tool helps researchers to manually pinpoint the locations required to perform standardized hand and face morphometry.

## Elevator Pitch
The _research organizer_ defines lists of landmarks, which in turn define lines and measurable segments in a simple CSV file to describe the data set required for a given investigation.
_Research assistants_ then manually locate the required points on photographs or scans, lines and segments are drawn automatically once their defining points have been set.
Finally point coordinates and segment lengths are exported to a CSV file for further processing, while graphical elements can be hidden or shown to prepare visual material for presentations.

### Download Binary Stable Release
A precompiled binary release archive for modern Windows systems 
(Win 7 or later with .NET 4.5) of the software and manual along with the 
description files („face.csv“, „palm.csv“) will shortly be available from [FacePalm_v1.0](http://www.psych2.phil.uni-erlangen.de/~oschult/humanlab/resources/resources_Facepalm.htm).

### Build Instructions
FacePalm is being developed with Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Enterprise, 
but should build with other editions as long as it can make sense of the
solution file.
