Face/Palm Measuring Tool: A stand-alone software for standardized hand and face morphometry

This tool helps researchers to manually pinpoint the locations required to perform standardized hand and face morphometry.

## Elevator pitch
The _research organizer_ defines lists of points, lines and segments in a simple CSV file to describe the data set required for a given investigation.
_Research assistants_ then manually locate the required points on photographs or scans, lines and segments are drawn automatically once their defining points have been set.
Finally point coordinates and segment lengths are exported to a CSV file for further processing.
